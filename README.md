# py3stem
These scripts act as an accompaniment to the pystem repository also here on the eMapr site. These scripts, particularly the STEM support scripts, were created for a project with the Southwest Alaska Inventory and Montiroing network (SWAN) and therefore they reflect data and processing (e.g. AK 5m IFSAR derived DEM) specific to that context. Note that this resource does not have the entire STEM framework converted to python 3 but rather some of the pre- and post-processing steps. Users should refer to the pystem repository for a complete archive of STEM scripts in python 2.7.
