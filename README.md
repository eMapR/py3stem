These scripts act as an accompaniment to the pystem repository also here on the eMapr site. These scripts, particularly the STEM support scripts, were created for a project with the Southwest Alaska Inventory and Montiroing network (SWAN) and therefore they reflect data and processing (e.g. AK 5m IFSAR derived DEM) specific to that context.
